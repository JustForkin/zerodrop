## Blacklist

The blacklist syntax is similar to that of [gitignore][1].

An optional prefix `!` which negates the pattern can be used for whitelisting. For example to only allow from local:

```
*      # First blacklist everyone
! ::1  # Allow localhost
```

An optional prefix `@` is for targeted geofencing, i.e., `@ lat lng (optional radius)`. The default radius is 25m. For example to block Atlantic City:

```
@ 39.377297 -74.451082 (7km)
```

| Unit      | Symbol |
| --------- | ------ |
| meter     | m      |
| kilometer | km     |
| mile      | mi     |
| feet      | ft     |

An optional prefix `~` indicates a hostname regular expression match.

```
shady.com
~ (.*)\.shady\.com # Block subdomains of shady
```

Use CIDR notation to denote a network: `192.168.2.0/24`
Or just list the IP address to block: `192.168.2.6`
Or just use a simple hostname match: `www.google.com`
